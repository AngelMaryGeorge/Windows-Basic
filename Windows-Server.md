3. **Role-based or Feature-based Installation**: Choose "Role-based or Feature-based Installation" and click Next.
4. **Select Server**: Select the server you wish to install IIS on and click Next.
5. **Select Server Roles**: Check "Web Server (IIS)" and add required features if prompted.
6. **Features**: You can skip the features page unless additional features are needed.
7. **Web Server Role (IIS)**: Review and click Next.
8. **Role Services**: Select the desired role services for your web server (Common options include HTTP Redirection, WebDAV Publishing, Application Development features, etc.).
9. **Confirmation**: Confirm selections and click Install.

### Configuration Steps

4. **Test the Setup**: Navigate to the serverâ€™s IP address or domain name in a web browser to verify that the IIS is working.

## Windows Active Directory
Active Directory (AD) is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. It is included in most Windows Server operating systems. Active Directory provides a variety of network services, including:

### Key Features
- **Domain Services**: Stores directory data and manages communication between users and domains.
- **Certificate Services**: Provides customizable services for issuing and managing public key certificates.
- **Federation Services**: Offers single sign-on (SSO) capabilities to authenticate a user across multiple web applications.
- **Lightweight Directory Services**: Supports directory-enabled applications using the open, industry-standard protocols.

### Setting Up Active Directory
1. **Install Active Directory Domain Services**:
    - Open Server Manager and click "Add Roles and Features."
    - Choose "Role-based or Feature-based Installation."
    - Select the server and check "Active Directory Domain Services."
    - Add features if prompted and click Install.
2. **Promote the Server to a Domain Controller**:
    - After installation, click on the notification flag and select "Promote this server to a domain controller."
    - Choose "Add a new forest" and enter your root domain name.
    - Complete the additional configuration steps, such as specifying the Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password.
    - Review and install the configuration.

### Managing Active Directory
1. **Open Active Directory Users and Computers**:
    - Use this tool to manage users, groups, and computers within your domain.
2. **Creating Organizational Units (OUs)**:
    - Organize users and resources within OUs to apply group policies efficiently.
3. **Adding Users and Groups**:
    - Right-click within an OU, select "New," and choose either "User" or "Group" to add new entries.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can successfully install and configure IIS and set up Active Directory on Windows Server, enabling you to host and manage web applications and network resources effectively.
