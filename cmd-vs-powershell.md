# CMD vs PowerShell


## What is CMD?
CMD (Command Prompt) is the command-line interpreter for Windows operating systems. 
It allows users to execute commands to perform various tasks such as file management, system configuration, and network troubleshooting.


## What is PowerShell?

PowerShell is a more advanced command-line shell and scripting language developed by Microsoft. 
It is designed for task automation and configuration management, providing more powerful and flexible tools compared to CMD.


## Difference between CMD and PowerShell

| Feature          | CMD                        | PowerShell              |
|------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| Shell Type       | Command-Line Interpreter   | Command-Line Shell and Scripting Language |
| Scripting        | Basic batch scripting      | Advanced scripting with .NET integration |
| Object-Oriented  | No                         | Yes                     |
| Command Syntax   | Traditional DOS commands   | cmdlets (e.g., `Get-Command`, `Set-ExecutionPolicy`) |
| Pipeline         | Text-based                 | Object-based            |
| Automation       | Limited                    | Extensive               |
| Extensibility    | Low                        | High                    |


### Example Commands

- **CMD**: `dir` - Lists directory contents

- **PowerShell**: `Get-ChildItem` - Similar to `dir` but returns objects representing the items

PowerShell's integration with the .NET framework allows it to perform complex operations that CMD cannot easily handle, making it a preferred choice for system administrators and power users.
